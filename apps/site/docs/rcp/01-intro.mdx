# Intro

Do you build react components? And do you also try to document them? How do you show the preview of the component?

> You may be using storybook or ladle, in that case this component is not for you

If you are building custom documentation like shadcn, tailwindui etc., you need a preview component which can be resized and it can show how component behaves responsively.

RCP (React Component Preview) Component is for that!

## IFramePreview Demo

import { IFramePreview } from "@locospec/react-component-preview";

<div className="twp">
  <IFramePreview srcUrl="/tailwind_2" height="500" />
</div>

## ChildPreview Demo

import { ChildPreview } from "@locospec/react-component-preview";
import ContainerQueryCard from "@site/src/components/ContainerQueryCard";

<div className="twp">
  <ChildPreview>
    <ContainerQueryCard />
  </ChildPreview>
</div>
